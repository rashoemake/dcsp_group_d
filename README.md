## DCSP Group D ##

### Statement of Work ###
The group will create a social networking application with the purpose of helping university students find study groups.  The application will allow users to create accounts and login, initially. Once a user has created an account, they will have the ability to start groups by approving or disproving of other users accounts.  If any two users approve each other, they will be placed in a new group together, after this point more users can be added to the group through the same process as long as at least 2/3 of the group members approve of the new user.  Grouped users will have the ability to exchange text communication in a SMS-style environment.  Users will be linked to groups in respective database tables, and in-group messages will be linked to their groups in their own table.
